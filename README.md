**The movie plot twist**
- The usual suspects
  : The sole survivor of a pier shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a seemingly random police lineup.
  > The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.[^1]
[^1]: Revealing that Roger "Verbal" Kint is Keyser Söze was such a good twist, because nobody suspect verbal to be keyser because verbal was presented as a dummy character. But everybody was fooled by that act even the police, they realize it to late because verbal/keyser got away.:grimacing::grimacing::grimacing:
